  <h1>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was
designed well and explain why</h1>
  <p>I believe that React JS is a very well-designed software. I have used it on various projects, but mainly for frontend development. 
    The library’s focus on reusable components made a significantly positive difference in the way I was able to develop web apps. 
    I think that this part of the software is really great because it helps developers create, debug, and complete projects faster 
    that they might with another type of library. It greatly helped with maintaining and building larger projects and made it more 
    clear for editing and debugging. Additionally, I noticed these characteristics assisted in collaboration and understanding when 
    working with others. Another reason I believe that React is an effective software is due to its use of virtual DOM updates.
    Instead of reloading the page every time there is a data update shown on the UI, React will update only what is necessary through
    the virtual DOM. This immensely speeds up loading times, improving the user experience. I have experienced this myself while working 
    on apps with real time updates and it helped me out with development a great deal.</p>
  
  <h1>Why is software design important?</h1>
  <p>Software design is very important because software systems must be readable and usable by the target audience. React is a great 
    example of this. React is a library for developers and its readability and flexibility is what makes it so popular among them. The way
    the library is designed with easy to recognize reusable components is what makes its software design so great for its target audience.
    The importance of software design in a software system is crucial because it is what the users are interacting with. It must be 
    engaging, but also usable and convenient. 
</p>
   <h1>What is happening in the requirements gathering stage and why is it important?</h1>
  <p>The purpose of the requirements gathering stage is to communicate with your client or user as the developer about the functionality of 
    their desired software system. One important topic that is discussed during this stage is the problem and how is this system going to solve it.
    This is very important to the entire development process because the developers must be clear about what problem they are solving. It ensures
    requirements bloat does not occur and developers do not stray away from the client’s problem. Additionally, the requirements must keep in mind the 
    client’s target audience. Ensuring that the system is user friendly, accessible, and appropriate for the user is extremely important to the user experience. 
    These requirements can be gathered in various ways, but communication is key. Asking questions is a great way of requirements gathering. Asking the right 
    questions can ensure the developer is creating exactly what the client wants. Requirements can also be gathered through surveys of user experience, and 
    using these results to add or alter them. All the requirements that have been gathered are put into a document called the Product Requirements Document. 
    This document is essential in the rest of the software life cycle.

  <h1>Write 5 user stories from writing assignment 1</h1>
  <p>- As the developer, I want pages to reload through a Virtual DOM, so that pages reload quicker and enhance the user experience
- As the developer, I want the functions and components to be readable, so that myself and my team can collaborate without confusion
- As the developer, I want the components to be flexible, so that I can develop without constraints
- As the developer, I want to be able to reuse my components, so that the development process is faster and more efficient and maintenance is easier
- As the developer, I want to be able to build visually striking and aesthetic user interfaces, so the user has a better experience
