  <h1>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was
designed well and explain why</h1>
  <p>I believe that React JS is a very well-designed software. I have used it on various projects, but mainly for frontend development. 
    The libraryâ€™s focus on reusable components made a significantly positive difference in the way I was able to develop web apps. 
    I think that this part of the software is really great because it helps developers create, debug, and complete projects faster 
    that they might with another type of library. It greatly helped with maintaining and building larger projects and made it more 
    clear for editing and debugging. Additionally, I noticed these characteristics assisted in collaboration and understanding when 
    working with others. Another reason I believe that React is an effective software is due to its use of virtual DOM updates.
    Instead of reloading the page every time there is a data update shown on the UI, React will update only what is necessary through
    the virtual DOM. This immensely speeds up loading times, improving the user experience. I have experienced this myself while working 
    on apps with real time updates and it helped me out with development a great deal.</p>
  
  <h1>Why is software design important?</h1>
  <p>Software design is very important because software systems must be readable and usable by the target audience. React is a great 
    example of this. React is a library for developers and its readability and flexibility is what makes it so popular among them. The way
    the library is designed with easy to recognize reusable components is what makes its software design so great for its target audience.
    The importance of software design in a software system is crucial because it is what the users are interacting with. It must be 
    engaging, but also usable and convenient.
